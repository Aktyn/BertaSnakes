TODO:
	Core.js - user's custom_data can be updated in database only when user disconnects from the server

	MOBILE VERSION - no WebGL, just simple canvas rendering on two layers
	
	SKILLS: ---

	Character creator - make player final apperance be combination of few small textures like background, hair eyes etc
	for sake of performance - final player apperance may be rendered to framebuffer texture

	allow user to manage texture packs (entities.data) within settings stage

	PATREON??

	AUTO QUAILITY IN SETTINGS MODE - lower settings on fps rate drop

	OPTIMIZE PARTICLES by not rendering those far beyond camera range
	AND MAKE REALLY TIME COMPARISION BETWEEN PARTICLES ITERATION ALGORITHMS - partially done
